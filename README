Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilized GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the RandomForestClassifier.
<br>
Cross-Validation: Included cross-validation in the grid search to ensure robust model evaluation.
<br>
ROC Curve and AUC: Added ROC curve and AUC score for better understanding of model performance, particularly for binary classification tasks.
<br>
Enhanced Visualizations: Added ROC curve to visualize the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.

>> random: For generating random slot machine spins.
>> pandas: For handling data in DataFrame format.
>> matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn: For creating static visualizations.
>> LabelEncoder: To encode categorical labels into numeric values.
>> train_test_split: To split data into training and testing sets.
>> cross_val_score: To evaluate the model with cross-validation (though not used directly here, it's good to have for general use).
>> GridSearchCV: To perform hyperparameter tuning.
>> RandomForestClassifier: The machine learning model used for classification.
>> accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report, roc_curve, roc_auc_score: For evaluating model performance.
>> numpy: For numerical operations (used here implicitly through other libraries).
